## Javascript

### What is Javascript?

Javascript is a scripting language used primarily in web pages, but also in many other programs/applications. Whereas HTML and CSS create the form of a page, javascript is responsible for the function of the page, to include any interactivity.

### Variables in JS

There are 4 ways to declare variables in javascript:
- var: outdated, but must be used for older browsers
- let: declares a variable that can be changed
- const: declares a variable that cannot be changed
- nothing: varables can just be assigned without a keyword

### Input and Output

Javascript and HTML work together to provide interactivity with the user.
