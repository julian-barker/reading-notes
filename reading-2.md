## Reading Assignment 2

### Text Editors:

- choosing a text editor is a personal choice. Your choices range from bare text editors to coding text editors to Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
  1. bare text editor - allows you to write text or code, but provides no helpful tools. Most operating systems have a native text editor such as Text edit for Mac.
  2. coding text editor - Provides helpful tools such as auto-completion, syntax highlighting, cosmetic themes, and extensions to aid in your coding experience. Seom examples include notepad++, Vim, and VSCode
  3. IDE - Integrated Development Environment - A full suite of software consisting of a text-editor, compiler, and debugger that allows you to do most or all of the coding process from that one platform. Often less flexible than a coding editor.

### Terminal

- pwd = print working directory
- cd = change directory
- mkdir = mk directory
- ls = list contents of current directory (add -a to include hidden files)
- file = get info on what type of file something is
- deal with spaces in file names by surrounding with quotes or escaping the space character with a backslash
