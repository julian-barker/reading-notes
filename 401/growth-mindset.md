# Growth Mindset

## What is it?

- "Growth mindset" refers to focusing on iterative improvement over current status. Another way to look at it could be to that it is changing your reference group for where you stand currently from your destination to your origin. That is, don't look at how far you still have to go. Instead, look at how far you've come.

## Why?

- A growth mindset is important for most people, but critically so for those entering a new industry.
- From a psychological perspective, it is easy to become discouraged after a period of time when chasing a far off goal, especially when you hit a road block or plateau.
- A growth mindset helps keep motivation and fvors consistency and disciplined incremental improvement, which also help prevent burnout.

## Caveats

- In my opinion, it does also help to maintain a clear picture of where you stand relative to where you would like to be, as long as that is not your primary metric for success. Dissatisfaction is the key driver of change. This is true for social change, but could also be true self-development!
