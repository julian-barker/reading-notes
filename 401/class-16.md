## AWS

### AWS EC2

- An EC2 instance is a portion of a cloud computer dedicated to running your software. It is a partitioned set of computation and memory resources
- One use case for EC2 is hosting a web-service, which could be a site, or some other backend software. You can train and deploy ML applications, run other high-performance software, and run cloud-native applications.
- One advantage of using Amazon EC2 over a service like Heroku is that if you are not paying an upcharged fee for the configuration and setup to be done for you.  EC2 can also dynamically adapt to changing resource needs.

### EC2 for Humans

- EC2 is the first link under the "compute" section
- The difference between T2 micro and XL is the amount of memory available, in GB of RAM
- 

### Elastic Beanstalk

- Elastic beanstalk is an easy way to spin up an EC2 instance. It is sort of analagous to other hosting services such as Heroku or Render.
- Elastic beanstalk requires less cofiguration than doing the same thing manually with an EC2 instance.
- I t automatically provides scaling, diagnostics/metrics, and load-balancing
