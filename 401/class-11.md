## Event-Driven Applications

### Event-Driven Programming

- Event Driven programming revolves around the concept of invoking calback functions as a response to events, which can be user inputs or something else.
- The program listens for events on the main loop and responds as necessary with the appropriate callback.
- Node.js has the native EventEmitter Module that allows us to start using event-driven programming. In addition several npm packages such as EventEmitter2 claim faster performance than the native implementation.
- Event-driven architecture takes advantage of the principal of encapsulation in OOP by maintaining the idea that all behavior of an object should be handled from inside it.
- Event-driven architecture leverages and reimagines standard "communication" between objects by changing the flow of data. Rather than an object telling another what to do, it shouts it out into space, at which point, another object, which is listening, hears it and performs an action to respond.
