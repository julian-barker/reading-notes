# Reading Assignment 1

## Using Markdown:

- Markdown allows for basic in-line styling of plaintext on a website without using HTML or CSS
- Use 1-6 hashtags (\#) at the start of a line to denote between 6 different levels of headings
  - ex. \#\#\# would be Heading 3 (see "Using Markdown" heading above)
- Sandwich text between single asterisks (\*) or underscores (\_) to *italicize*
- Sandwich text between single asterisks (\*\*) or underscores (\_\_) to make **bold**
- Create an ordered list with a hyphen (\-) or asterisk (\*) followed by a space at the start of a line
- Use backticks (\`) at the start and end of a portion of text to create an `in-line quote`
- Use a right-facing carrot (\>) at the start of a line to create a block quote
> Block quote
- Add an image in one of three ways
  1. \! [alt text] (source)
  2. html: \<img src="source" alt="alt text"\>
  3. drag and drop an image into the edit box at the desired line
- Add color call-outs in three formats:
  1. HEX (hexadecimal) - \`#RRGGBB\` - value 0-F - `#00FFFF`
  2. RGB (redg/green/blue) - \`rgb(R,G,B)\` - value 0-255 - `rgb(255,0,255)`
  3. HSL (hue/saturation/light) 0 \`hsl(H,S,L)\` - value H=0-360 S/L=0-100% - `hsl(200, 50%, 80%)`
- Mention a person or a team with \@ followed by their name ex. @julian-barker . This will send send them a notification.
- Add a link by pasting one in or typing the text or name of the link in brackets ( \[\] ) followed by the url in parentheses ex. \[My Reading Notes\](https://julian-barker.github.io/reading-notes/) becomes [My Reading Notes](https://julian-barker.github.io/reading-notes/)-
