# Reading Assignment 7

## Programming in Javascript

### Control Flow

- control flow is the order in which statements are executed in javascript
- code is run from the top line to the bottom line unless it encounters structures such as loops and conditionals that change the flow

### Functions

- a function is a block of code that performs a specific task
- functions are defined with the `function` keyword, a name for the function, the function's parameters in parentheses, and a set of curly braces containing the executable code
- function parameters are inside the function parentheses when it is defined. When the function is called, the elements inside arre called its arguments

### Operators

- Arithmetic operators include:
    - `+` addition
    - `-` subtraction
    - `*` multiplication
    - `/` division
    - `**` exponentiation
    - `%` modulus
    - `++` increment
    - `--` decrement

- Assignment operators assign a value to a variable. Examples include:
    - `=` x = y
    - `+=` same as `x = x + y`
    - `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `**=`, `%=` function in the same pattern as `+=`

- String operators operate on a string or strings. `+` concatenates, and `+=` functions similarly as in arithmetic

- Comparison operators compare two variables and usual return a boolean value (true/false)
    - `==` equal to
    - `===` true equal (equal in value and type)
    - `!=` not equal
    - `>` greater than
    - `<` less than
    - `>=` greater than or equal to
    - `<=` less than or equal to
    - `?` evaluates an expression and executes one espression if truthy and a different expression if falsy
