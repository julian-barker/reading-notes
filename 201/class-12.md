## Canvas

- The `<canvas>` element allows you to draw on your page with javascript, making graphics, games, apps, and more.
- The closing tag is important because any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content to be displayed in browsers that don't support the `<canvas>` element
- The `getContext()` method that returns a render context object. It takes a single argument, which is the type of context. i.e. '2d'

## Chart.js

- Chart.js allows displaying visually appealing charts with nothing more than a `<script>` and a `<canvas>` element.
- Using chart.js, you can create different types of charts, such as line, bar, pie, scatter, radar, and polar area
- Data displayed over a chart is generally more visually appealing than a table. Furthermore, you can gather the key takeaway and trend without taking in every value. It is a quicker way to familiarize another person with the results and implications of a set of data
- Chart.js could be useful for tracking sales snd staff projections in the cookies stand lab, as well as potentially for tracking views and votes for the product tester.
