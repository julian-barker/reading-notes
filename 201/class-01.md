## Basics of Web Development

- These readings cover the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and web design.
- They are important to know before delving deeper into the mechanics of how to build on the web.
- If you don't know what a good product looks like, you can't hope to build one

## Getting Started

1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.
    - haiku\n
Hypertext Transfer\n
Defines how computers talk\n
Lets you browse the web
2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
    - The browser first receives the HTML file. From there, it sends back requests to the server for any CSS files and then any javascript files that are linked to within the HTML file. It then builds the page and applies the styling and scripting as necessary
3. How can you find images to add to a Website?
    - You can add images by linking to component files or assets, or by linking to images hosted elsewhere on the web
4. How do you create a `String` vs a `Number` in JavaScript?
    - JS is weakly typed, so you do not always need to specify. However, numbers can be assigned to variables as is, while strings must have the contents placed within a pair of double or single quotes.
5. What is a `Variable` and why are they important in JavaScript?
    - a Variable is a container for values we want to use later.

## Introduction to HTML

1. What is an HTML attribute?
    - attributes contain extra info about an element that do not appear in the content
2. Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.
    - an HTML element has an openeing tag `<>` (which may contain some attributes), content, and a closig tag `</>`.
3. What is the Difference between `<article>` and `<section>` element tags?
    - an `<article>` tag specifies a piece of content that can stand on its own outside of the context of the site. a `<section>` tag refers to a subset of a larger piece of content
4. What Elements does a “typical” website include?
    - A typical site contains a header, a nav bar, a main body, sometimes a sidebar, and a footer.
5. How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?
    - a description containing keywords pertinent to the content of your page may make your site appear higher in search relevant searches
6. How is the `<meta>` HTML tag used when specifying metadata?
    - it is used in conjunction with the name and content attributes (ex. name="author" content="Julian Barker")

## How to Start to Design a Website

1. What is the first step to designing a Website?
    - the first step is to answer several key questions for yourself:
        - What exactly do I want to accomplish?
        - How will a website help me reach my goals?
        - What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?
2. What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website?
    - Of those, the most important question is "What do I want to accomplish". This will inform not only the content, but the design, structure, and fucntionality, or lack thereof

## Semantics

1. Why should you use an `<h1>` element over a `<span>` element to display a top level heading?
    - using the right tag helps other developers or people with vision impairments better understand the structure and layout of the page.
2. What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?
    - semantic tags help describe the contents agnostic of applied styling, which aids in reading HTML code, but also provides accessibility for those with vision impairments

## What is Javascript?

1. Describe 2 things that require JavaScript in the Browser?
    - javascript is required for a page to store variables and to create and interact with APIs, which allow you to build code by cobbling together pre-assebmbled groups of legos as opposed to from scratch using only the smallest pieces.
2. How can you add JavaScript to an HTML document?
    - add javascript to an HTML document with `<script>` tags, either using inline scripting or linking to an external .js file.
