## What Google Learned from its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

- The article with the above title was about Google's Project Aristotle, a research project to analyze various teams and divine patterns in members' backgrounds and behaviors that led to a team's being successful or not
- Interestingly, the research team found no significant patterns in the backgrounds of team members, leading them to the conclusion that the "who" does not matter as much as intuition would lead you to believe. Building the best team is not simply about building a team of the best people
- Interpersonal factors matter greatly to team success. Specifically, psychological safety can be a predictor of success. This refers to things such as equality in conversational turn-taking and average social sensitivity.
- psychological safety is a group culture that is a "shared belief held by members of the team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking".
- Knowing this is not enough, however. The researchers sought to quantify and replicate these qualities in teams to increase their performance.
- Creating human, emotional bonds can increase the feeling of psychological safety in a group
- Not having psychological safety can lead people to feel that they are living two separate lives between work and home, and that is tiring, because an enormous amount of your time in life is spent at work.
- The ironic thing is that thousands of man-hours and troves of data points later, and the Aristotle team is left with the same conventional wisdom that some have long known: in good teams, members listen to each other and are valued
