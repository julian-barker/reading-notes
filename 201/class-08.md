### Flexbox

- Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content - this means that any given flex container is can only really array its children in one dimension
- The main axis is the axis that the elements are arrayed in. By default, the main axis is the horizontal axis, and elements sit side-by-side. The cross-axis is perpendicular to the main axis.
- certain properties of flex, such as reverse, can negatively impact accessibility because they present things in a different order visually than they are arrayed in the HTML.
- Flexbox provides a relatively easy way to position things where you want them and maintain responsiveness for different-sized screens
- Some aspects of flexbox:
  - can display horizontally or vertically
  - respect the writing mode of the document
  - ability to wrap
  - items can be ordered away from their DOM order
  - empty space can be distributed to items - dynamic sizing of children
