### Troubleshooting

- Syntax errors are errors where you made a spelling or other such mistake that caused the code to stop running and produced an error message. Logic errors are errors where the code is syntactically correct, and runs, but gives a wrong/unexpected result.
  - syntax errors: you wrote the code wrong
  - logic errors: you wrote the wrong code
- Some errors I've had are type errors where I try to use something as a function that isn't one, and syntax errors such as missing or extra parentheses, brackets, braces. The punctuation is an easy fix, but sometimes the type errors require a good amount of console logging to find out where I went wrong
- Troubleshooting is a critically important skill to develop now for my future, since I can be guaranteed to make mistakes, and the faster I can identify and fix them, the more efficient I will be, and the better I will become at avoiding them.

### Javascript Debugger

- The JS debugger tool is a great tool that lets you break down your function and peak under the hood while it is running to see where you might have done something wrong. It allows you to pause, resume, and fast forward, similar to watching it play one in slow motion
- The debugger allows you to track the state of variables and functions step by step as the code executes each successive line.
- You can set breakpoints to stop a function at a certain point so that you can examine it more closely from that point on. This saves you having to step through every single line to get to a problem spot.
- The call stack is a last in, first out data structure that keeps track of all the functions that need to be run in a program. It executes from the top down. The call stack portion of the debugger shows you what code has been run to reach the current point in the program.
