## Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

* Efficiency
* Collaboration
* Learning from peers
* Social skills
* Job interview readiness
* Work environment readiness

3. How does pair programming work?
  One person acts as the "driver" and is physically typing and doing the work on their machine, while the other person is the "navigator" and dictates/describes what the driver should be doing. The navigator does not necessarily spell everything out verbatim, but clearly talks through the actions, desired outcomes, and thought processes.
