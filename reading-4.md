### Wireframing

A wireframe is a design for a website that shows layout and interaction without other elements that could be distracting or are extraneous at this point in the process (such as text, colors, fonts). However, wireframes can have as little or as much detail as you desire. Some software tools to wireframe include Invision, Balsamiq, UXPin, and wireframe.cc, but wireframes can be created by hand with paper and pen/pencil. there are some advantages to this, as well as personal preference. Doing it on a computer allows easier saving and tracking of changes.

#### Steps to Wireframe

1. Research - Look for examples an inspiration
2. Prepare research to reference - save examples and highlight specifics to reference
3. Map user flow - make sure the design supports the end user being able to easily and intuitively do what they want and get where they want
4. Focus on design quality, not art quality
5. Add basic details and test - fill in top to bottom, left to right
6. Prototype - go from low-fidelity to high-fidelity

### All (Or just a little...) About HTML

- HTML = **H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage
- HTML is formed by elements that contain contain and nest within each other to create the structure of the webpage.
- Elements have an opening tag (<>), the content ("some random content"), and a closing tag (</>).
- For example, a paragraph would be
    - \<p>The cow jumped over the moon\</p>
- Elements can nest within each other. A nested element opens after its parent opens and closes before its parent closes (
    - \<p> Stuff and things \<div> Text, text, text \</div> \</p>)
- Different Elements:
    - \<!DOCTYPE html> - a required tag at the start of an HTML file
    - \<html> \</html> - a tag that wraps the entirety of the html content. The highest level container, or root element
    - \<head> \</head> - contains all things to be included on the page that are not shown to viewers, such as style instructions and descriptions
    - \<meta charset="utf-8"> - specifies the set of characters ofor the document to use
    - \<title> \</title> - sets the title of the page that appears in the browser tab
    - \<body> \</body> - contains averything on the page you wish to show to the viewers
