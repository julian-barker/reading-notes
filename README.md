## Growth Mindset

- A growth mindset is one that focuses on the journey, rather than the destination. Contrasted with a fixed mindset, a growth mindset enables you to focus on constant progress, however small, and the power of compounding small improvements. A growth mindset says you can learn and change to better yourself!

### Tips for maintaining a growth mindset:

1. Obstacles are opportunities for improvement. You *will* encounter problems - solving them is a critical skill in and of itself. (also, ask for help if you need!)
2. Criticism is an important part of the feedback loop of progress - take it in, **reflect**, and apply it if necessary.
3. Other people's success does not take away from your own - it should **inspire**.
