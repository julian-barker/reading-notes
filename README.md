## About Me

- Hi, I’m Julian Barker. I am coming out of 6 years in the Army as an Infantry Officer. I have a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, but I’m now interested in learning cyber security and software/web development. In my free time, I enjoy Scuba diving, hunting, and would like to learn to fish. I also enjoy climbing, surfing, being in the wilderness, playing with my dog, and watching anime / reading manga (especially One Piece)

## Growth Mindset

- A growth mindset is one that focuses on the journey, rather than the destination. Contrasted with a fixed mindset, a growth mindset enables you to focus on constant progress, however small, and the power of compounding small improvements. A growth mindset says you can learn and change to better yourself!

### Tips for maintaining a growth mindset

1. Obstacles are opportunities for improvement. You *will* encounter problems - solving them is a critical skill in and of itself. (also, ask for help if you need!)
2. Criticism is an important part of the feedback loop of progress - take it in, **reflect**, and apply it if necessary.
3. The success of others does not take away from your own - rather, it should **inspire** you and maybe serve as azimuth for your progression.

In the words of William Ernest Henley:

> I am the master of my fate,
> I am the captain of my soul.
