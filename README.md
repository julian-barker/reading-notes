## About Me

## Growth Mindset

- A growth mindset is one that focuses on the journey, rather than the destination. Contrasted with a fixed mindset, a growth mindset enables you to focus on constant progress, however small, and the power of compounding small improvements. A growth mindset says you can learn and change to better yourself!

### Tips for maintaining a growth mindset:

1. Obstacles are opportunities for improvement. You *will* encounter problems - solving them is a critical skill in and of itself. (also, ask for help if you need!)
2. Criticism is an important part of the feedback loop of progress - take it in, **reflect**, and apply it if necessary.
3. The success of others does not take away from your own - rather, it should **inspire** you and maybe serve as azimuth for your progression.

In the words of William Ernest Henley:

> I am the master of my fate, 
> I am the captain of my soul.

## Reading Notes

### Day 1

#### Using Markdown:

- Markdown allows for basic in-line styling of plaintext on a website without using HTML or CSS
- Use 1-6 hashtags (\#) at the start of a line to denote between 6 different levels of headings
  - ex. \#\#\# would be Heading 3 (see "Day 1" above)
- Sandwich text between single asterisks (\*) or underscores (\_) to *italicize*
- Sandwich text between single asterisks (\*\*) or underscores (\_\_) to make **bold**
- Create an ordered list with a hyphen (\-) or asterisk (\*) followed by a space at the start of a line
- Use backticks (\`) at the start and end of a portion of text to create an `in-line quote`
- Use a right-facing carrot (\>) at the start of a line to create a block quote
> Block quote
- Add an image in one of three ways
  1. \! [alt text] (source)
  2. html: \<img src="source" alt="alt text"\>
  3. drag and drop an image into the edit box at the desired line
- Add color call-outs in three formats:
  1. HEX (hexadecimal) - \`#RRGGBB\` - value 0-F - `#00FFFF`
  2. RGB (redg/green/blue) - \`rgb(R,G,B)\` - value 0-255 - `rgb(255,0,255)`
  3. HSL (hue/saturation/light) 0 \`hsl(H,S,L)\` - value H=0-360 S/L=0-100% - `hsl(200, 50%, 80%)`
- Mention a person or a team with \@ followed by their name ex. @julian-barker . This will send send them a notification.
- Add a link by pasting one in or typing the text or name of the link in brackets ( \[\] ) followed by the url in parentheses ex. \[My Reading Notes\](https://julian-barker.github.io/reading-notes/) becomes [My Reading Notes](https://julian-barker.github.io/reading-notes/)

#### Text Editors:

- choosing a text editor is a personal choice. Your choices range from bare text editors to coding text editors to Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
  1. bare text editor - allows you to write text or code, but provides no helpful tools. Most operating systems have a native text editor such as Text edit for Mac.
  2. coding text editor - Provides helpful tools such as auto-completion, syntax highlighting, cosmetic themes, and extensions to aid in your coding experience. Seom examples include notepad++, Vim, and VSCode
  3. IDE - Integrated Development Environment - A full suite of software consisting of a text-editor, compiler, and debugger that allows you to do most or all of the coding process from that one platform. Often less flexible than a coding editor.

### Terminal

- pwd = print working directory
- cd = change directory
- mkdir = mk directory
- ls = list contents of current directory (add -a to include hidden files)
- file = get info on what type of file something is
- deal with spaces in file names by surrounding with quotes or escaping the space character with a backslash
